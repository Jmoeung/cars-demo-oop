# Cars Class - Python OOP Challenge

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python by creating a `Car` class to represent car objects with various attributes.

## Description

The `Car` class models a car with attributes such as make, model, and year. It includes an initializer to set these attributes when a new object is created and a method to display the carâ€™s information in a formatted string. The project creates multiple car instances and prints their details to showcase OOP concepts.

## Key Features

- Define a Python class with an initializer (`__init__` method)
- Create multiple instances (objects) of the class with unique attributes
- Use instance methods to display object information

## Skills Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:
  - Class creation
  - Initializers to set instance variables
  - Instance methods
  - Creating and managing multiple objects (instances)
- Python syntax for classes and methods
- Basic string formatting for output
